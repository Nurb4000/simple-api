just a simple Linux management API, written in python and flask, that offers endpoints of things i personally find useful.

So far:

          simple authentication
          File listings
          Download files
          Upload files
          Remove files
          Uptime
          Current processes
          Reboot remote server
          kill a process
          shutdown remote device
          Run a shell command

  more to come!
